# this code extracts amino acid and PLDDT from the pdb file (downloaded from alphafold) 
# and secondary structure from the dat file (produced by dssp in a conda env) and 
# stores the results in an .out file

# 10/19/2022 changed the PLDDT column from line.split()[4] to line.split()[-2]
# to cater for cases where line.split() does not contain 12 items.
# Added a try block for cases where .dat files exist instead of .dssp
