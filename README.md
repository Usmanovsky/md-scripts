# md-scripts
## Python and Bash scripts that mostly help prepare, run and analyze MD simulations for deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and proteins on GROMACS
Each project folder has its own scripts. These scripts have kept me warm on cold, lonely nights during my PhD. I hope they comfort you as well.
- **[DES-DES](./DES-DES)** houses scripts for simulating nultiple DESs in a box.
- **[DES-IRC](./DES-IRC)** scripts are for the automation of lots of simulations e.g. if you have 500 DESs to simulate and analyze.
- **[DES-Water](./DES-Water)** scripts are for simulating mixtures of aqueous DES systems.
- **[alpha-fold](./alpha-fold)** scripts are for the analysis of the fairness of the proteing structure predictions of AlphaFold2
- **[deepchem](./deepchem)** scripts handle a host of scenarios for training ML models using the DeepChem package.
- **[des-ml](./des-ml)** scripts can be used to train ML algorithms using the HB features of DES systems. The models can predict which 
systems will form DESs or not.
- **[interface](./interface)** scripts help analyze hydrogen bond properties of DES-Water inetrfaces.
- **[jupyter-scripts](./jupyter-scripts)** are a group of jupyter notebooks that make iterative analysis of MD data easier.
- **[lab-gpu](./lab-gpu)** scripts help with a bunch of house-cleaning operations on a local workstation.
- **[metadynamics](./metadynamics)** are for running well-tempered metadynamics simulations of plastic extraction using DESs.
- **[multi-view](./multi-view)** scripts help with protein structure prediction using sequences and contact maps.
- **[orca](./orca)** scripts for running QM jobs on ORCA.
- **[plastic-extraction](./plastic-extraction)** scripts help set up and run MD simulations for DES-Water extraction processes.
- **[template-md](./template-md)** are boiler-plate codes for running MD simulations on HPC clusters. The scripts also calculate properties
  like RDF, HB number and lifetime.
